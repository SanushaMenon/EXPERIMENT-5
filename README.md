# EXPERIMENT-5

AIM:
To understand the syntax and working of loops in C++.

THEORY:
For Loop-
A For loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to write a loop that is executed a specific number of times. The loop enables us to perform n number of steps together in one line. 
While Loop-
While studying for loop we have seen that the number of iterations is known beforehand, i.e. the number of times the loop body is needed to be executed is known to us. while loops are used in situations where we do not know the exact number of iterations of the loop beforehand.
Do-while loop
In Do-while loops also the loop execution is terminated on the basis of test conditions. The main difference between a do-while loop and the while loop is in the do-while loop the condition is tested at the end of the loop body, i.e do-while loop is exit controlled whereas the other two loops are entry-controlled loops.
